# 📚 The Study Vault: Algorithms & Tech Notes

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](http://makeapullrequest.com)
[![LeetCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/LeetCode-FFA116?style=for-the-badge&logo=LeetCode&logoColor=black)](https://leetcode.com/u/YOUR_LEETCODE_USERNAME/)

First, I know how this readme chatgpt like is, I just want to get DS&A done and doing well on leetcode contest and also pass the BigTech company's interview. I will keep updating 3 leetcode problems a day and hope someone can share their knowledge to me and help me to find some mistake in this repo or push me update daily question :). I did not major in CS but currently work as a software engineer writing about some firmware program with C and some application in CPP.<br>
This repository is my personal knowledge base for algorithms and data structures. **My goal is to document every algorithm I master and discover new ones through community collaboration.**

> [!TIP]
> **🌟 Missing an Algorithm? Share it!**
> If you know a clever algorithm or an optimization that isn't listed here, please contribute! Whether it's a classic pattern or a niche trick, I want to learn from your expertise.
